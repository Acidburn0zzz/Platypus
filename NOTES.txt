Some notes on the code

The Platypus source code is in a somewhat sorry state.  It's very old software, dating back to the early days of Mac OS X.  
It was originally written in C using the Carbon APIs, but later transitioned to Cocoa during the time I was learning
to use Objective-C and the Cocoa APIs, and made many mistakes.  The software has gone through over two dozen 
significant versions; it has been patched, bugfixed, streamlined to include new features and partially refactored to 
fit in with modern Objective-C practices.  Much crust remains.  I once tried to create a new major version which was 
supposed to leave much of the old codebase behind it, but the task grew daunting in size and I was unable to find the time.

That being said, hitherto recited caveats being kept in mind, this is the GPL'd source code to Platypus.  At least 
it's meticulously commented.  Enjoy.
