# Platypus

<img align="right" src="Documentation/images/platypus.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;">

**Platypus** is a developer tool that creates native Mac applications
from interpreted scripts such as shell scripts or Perl and Python programs.
This is done by wrapping the script in an 
[application bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_(OS_X)#OS_X_application_bundles)
directory structure  along with an application binary that runs the script.

Platypus makes it easy to share scripts and programs with those 
unfamiliar with the command line interface. Native user-friendly
applications can be created with a few clicks. It is very easy to
create installers, administrative applications, login items, status menu items, 
launchers, automations and droplets using Platypus.

## Some notes on the code

Platypus is very old software, dating back to the early days of Mac OS X, circa 2003.  It was originally written in C using the
Carbon APIs, but later transitioned to Cocoa during the time I was learning to use Objective-C and the Cocoa
APIs. I made many beginner mistakes, some of which remain in the code.  This software has  since gone through about
four dozen significant versions. It has been patched, bugfixed, streamlined to include new features and was
recently transitioned over to modern Objective C. It's not how I would write it today.

With these caveats in mind, here is the BSD-licensed source code to Platypus.
