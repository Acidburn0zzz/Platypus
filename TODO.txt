Long term feature roadmap:

    * Get STDERR output and pid for STPrivilegedTask
    * Ability to add arbitrary arguments to script itself, not just interpreter
    * More bidirectional communication
    * Icon editable for file types
    * Create Platypus tutorial videos
    * Rewrite nasty old code in STFileList and derivatives
    * Rethink and redesign the interface? It's a bit cluttered and could do with some Lionizing
    * Create TextMate plugin
