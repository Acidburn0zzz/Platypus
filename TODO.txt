Long term feature roadmap:

    * More bidirectional communication
    * Icon editable for file types
    * Create Platypus tutorial videos
    * Rewrite nasty, old code in STFileList and derivatives
    * Rethink and redesign the interface? It's a bit cluttered and could do with some Lionising
    * Create TextMate plugin
    * Restore "icon from image" functionality in command line tool
