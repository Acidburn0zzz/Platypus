Platypus is a developer tool for the Mac OS X operating system. 

It can be used to create native Mac OS X applications from interpreted 
scripts such as shell scripts or Perl and Python programs. This is done 
by wrapping the script in an application bundle directory structure 
along with an executable binary that runs the script.

Platypus makes it easy for you to share your scripts and programs 
with those unfamiliar with the command line interface, without any 
knowledge of the native Mac OS X APIs -- a few clicks and you will have 
your own Mac OS X graphical program. Creating installers, maintenance 
applications, login items, launchers, automations and droplets is 
very easy using Platypus.
